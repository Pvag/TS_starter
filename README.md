# TypeScript Starter Project

## What

A basic TypeScipt-ready project, so that you can start playing around
with TypeScript, without the hassle of configuring the compiler,
environment, packages, and so on.

This comes in really handy, whenever you are experimenting with TS.

## Usage

### Install the project-related package

`npm i`

### Compile

`npm run build`

### Compile and watch for changes

`npm run build_watch`

### Compile and run

`npm start`

(Only compiles and runs ./build/index.ts.)
